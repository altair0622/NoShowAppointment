# Investigate a Dataset
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program


# Project Overview
## Summary

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

##Data set

No-show appointments (original source on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments))

This dataset collects informationfrom 100k medical appointments inBrazil and is focused on the questionof whether or not patients show upfor their appointment. A number ofcharacteristics about the patient areincluded in each row.

## What I have learned from the project:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
